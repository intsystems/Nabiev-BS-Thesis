## Abstract
This paper tackles the problem of constructing suboptimal models within multitask learning paradigm. Given a set of intrinsically related tasks, the goal is to uncover a shared structure—known as the inductive bias—across all tasks. By applying constrained evolutionary symbolic regression, we show that these models can be decomposed in a way that reveals the tasks' underlying structure. We performed experiments on synthetic data, where the data structure, generation process, and optimal models are known. The results indicate that the models produced by the proposed method are indeed optimal for their respective tasks.
